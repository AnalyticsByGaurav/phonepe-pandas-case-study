(Analyzing Transaction and Demographic Data)
## Objective
This case study involves analyzing transaction data from the financial application PhonePe along with demographic data across various states and districts in India. The objective is to provide insights into transaction trends, device usage, and demographic correlations, while ensuring data consistency and performing advanced analyses to uncover deeper insights.
The datasets span multiple years and quarters, providing a comprehensive view of transactions, user behavior, and demographic details. Participants are expected to use their Python skills to load, explore, and analyze the data, ultimately deriving meaningful insights and visualizations.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Analysis Performed
- Data cleaning
- Year-wise & state-wise analysis
- Trend identification
- Visualization

## Key Insights
- ## Population Density vs Transactions:
A moderate positive correlation (~0.43) exists between population density and total transactions. Densely populated areas generally record higher transaction volumes, but population alone does not explain usage. Other factors such as income levels, smartphone penetration, and digital awareness also influence transaction activity.

- ## Overall Growth Trend:
PhonePe transactions show a clear upward trend over time. Growth is slow in the early years and accelerates significantly in later years, indicating strong adoption of digital payments across India.

- Impact of COVID-19:
A temporary dip in transactions is observed around 2020 due to COVID-19. However, the recovery is quick, and the long-term growth trend remains strong.

- Top 5 States by Total Transactions:
Maharashtra, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Telangana, and Andhra Pradesh contribute the highest transaction volumes, highlighting their strong digital payment adoption.

- Bottom 5 States by Total Transactions:
Ladakh, Lakshadweep, Andaman & Nicobar Islands, Mizoram, and Nagaland show the lowest transaction volumes, mainly due to lower population density and limited digital infrastructure.

- Urban and Economically Active Regions Lead:
States with higher urbanization and economic activity consistently record higher transaction volumes, showing the importance of infrastructure and digital readiness.

- Top 5 Most Used Mobile Brands:
Xiaomi, Samsung, Vivo, Oppo, and Realme dominate device usage, indicating that mid-range Android smartphones drive most digital transactions.

- Android Device Dominance:
The majority of transactions are performed on Android devices, reflecting affordability and wide accessibility.

- Quarter-wise Growth Pattern:
Transaction volumes increase steadily across quarters, with visible spikes during festive and high-spending periods.

- Expansion Beyond Metro Cities:
While metro states lead in volume, tier-2 and tier-3 regions show rapid growth, indicating deeper penetration of digital payments across the country.
